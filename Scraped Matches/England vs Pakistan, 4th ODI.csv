Thick top-edge on the slog-sweep, it loops up behind short midwicket and Fakhar Zaman takes a fantastic catch running back.

"Imad Wasim to Buttler, out Caught by Mohammad Hasnain!! Jos Buttler has fallen for a duck to a leg stump full toss! Pakistan are back in this one. Just a juicy little delivery drifting in from round the wicket, Buttler's almost too eager. He looks to swat it through square leg but in doing so, his wrists go through with the shot too quickly.

But he times his jump well, sticks a hand out, fumbles the first time but grabs it on the second attempt. Brilliant catch. Root wanted to loft it down the ground, but wasn't to the pitch of this delivery, hence the error. Root c Hafeez b Imad Wasim 36(41) [4s-3]",28.3

"Mohammad Hasnain to Roy, out Caught by Sarfaraz!! Was there some glove down the leg side? The finger goes up, and Roy's walking. He was strangled by this short ball on leg stump, hurried on the pull and couldn't manage more than a bit of glove. Walks off to a standing ovation after a superb knock. Roy c Sarfaraz b Mohammad Hasnain 114(89) [4s-11 6s-4]",27.4

He's having a miserable evening in the field, which he's spent taking a lot of stick from the crowd. Won't get any easier from here. Root got almost too close to this one, so couldn't find much elevation. But he did strike it hard. Should've been caught though. No excuses. Sarfaraz is livd",26.3
"Imad Wasim to Root, FOUR, drifting down leg, Root picks line early and paddles it fine enough to make it difficult for Hasnain at fine leg, and he isn't able to bend quick enough to stop it",26.2

"Mohammad Hasnain to Roy, 2 runs, slower short ball, Hasnain tries to add to the deception by grunting in delivery, and it almost works. Roy did well to adjust though, after initially hurrying through the pull. He holds his shot and checks it backward of square",25.4

"Hasan Ali to Root, 5 wides, the skipper won't be happy. The previous one was wided for height and now Hasan Ali bangs it in further shot. Nothing doing from Root and Sarfaraz can't do much about it. Five runs gifted away to England by the generous Pakistanis",24.5

Wasn't a bad ball by any means. Tremendous use of the feet from the opener. Converts a decent ball into a short one by going deep in his crease and then bludgeons it over deep extra cover for a maximum. Yes, a lofted drive off the back foot!",23.4
"Hafeez to Roy, FOUR, bad ball. Hafeez shortens his length a tad and that's more than enough for Roy. He backs away and spanks it through wide mid-off",23.3

"Hafeez to Roy, 2 runs, slower, tossed up ball, Roy moves leg-side to carve it over extra cover. Doesn't get it anywhere close to the middle, but somehow gets enough wood on this outside edge that goes over cover",23.1
"Hasan Ali to Root, no run, full ball that tails in - reverse? Yes. Root is late on his flick and gets rapped on the front pad. A muted appeal for lbw, that was surely going down leg",22.6

"Mohammad Hasnain to James Vince, out Bowled!! Mohammad Hasnain strikes! Much-needed breakthrough for Pakistan. Vince backed away and Hasnain followed him with a skiddy length ball at 88.2mph. The right-handed batter gets cramped for room and is a touch late to bring his bat down - courtesy the pace. Gets an under edge that clatters onto the stumps. James Vince b Mohammad Hasnain 43(39) [4s-6]",13.3

"Mohammad Hasnain to James Vince, FOUR, this is clumsy from Junaid. This will only rile up the Pakistan captain. Excellent short ball from Hasnain, had every ingredient to trouble Vince as it rose up sharply. He went for the pull and gets rushed by the pace and bounce. Thick top-edge balloons up and falls in no-man's land at fine leg. Junaid runs across, doesn't bend low in time and went with one-hand to stop that and made a mess of it at the fence",11.6

"Imad Wasim to Roy, 2 runs, oh, Fakhar Zaman! What have you done? Agree it wasn't an easy chance but once he covered good ground and got both hands, should have taken it. It's a big let-off and will Roy make them pay for it? Only time will tell. It was quicker and skidded through, Roy was through his attempted loft early and lost his balance.

"Mohammad Hasnain to Roy, no run, optimistic appeal for lbw but it seemed to be going down leg. Sarfaraz walks down the pitch and has a chat with the bowler -- who flagged it off the possibility of taking a review.

"Mohammad Hasnain to Roy, no run, 86.6mph, pacy short delivery outside off. Keeps low and Roy pats it to point",7.1
"Imad Wasim to Roy, 1 run, nice and clever from Imad. Saw the batsman move to leg, so he slowed it up and followed Roy - who despite getting in an awkward position goes after it and only succeeds in inside-edging it to backward square leg",6.6

"Junaid Khan to James Vince, no run, comes round the wicket and gets it to nip off the seam, Vince loses his grip and tamely jabs it to mid-wicket",4.4
"Junaid Khan to James Vince, FOUR, this was dismissive from Vince. Stand and deliver stuff. Identifies a full delivery just outside off, loads up and unleashes his bottom-hand power to belt it past the non-striker. Junaid looks in disbelief, sigh!",4.3
"Junaid Khan to James Vince, FOUR, this is atrocious, these quick outfield and smaller boundaries, I tell you.. it was on a length, around off. Vince went too hard at it and lost his shape by skewing it off the inner half. But manages to beat mid-on. The fielder gave the chase but to no avail",4.2
