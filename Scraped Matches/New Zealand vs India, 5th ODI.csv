"Hardik Pandya to Matt Henry, SIX, now this is a nothing ball from Pandya. Slower one dug into the pitch, sits up for Henry who hacks it over square leg, even more convincing than the previous one if that's even possible",43.5
"Hardik Pandya to Matt Henry, SIX, short ball outside off, Henry bulldozes this pull over cow corner, much like Pandya had done himself earlier in the day. Just brute power",43.4

"Kedar Jadhav to Neesham, out Neesham Run Out!! What on earth was Neesham doing? Presence of mind from MSD and he's run-out. He's celebrating. Firstly this was a huge appeal for LBW, umpire Shaun George shook his head, looked like an inside edge onto thigh pad or even if it didn't take the edge impact was outside off stump. Dhoni was busy appealing, so the ball hit his left leg and rolled back, Neesham was wandering out of the crease for some reason, probably more keen on looking at the umpire than realising he was outside the crease, Dhoni runs back and fires a direct-hit to send back the danger man. Neesham looked like finishing this in 7-8 overs. In fact he was asking Santner for a run when the ball was just a couple of yards away from Dhoni. Didn't know where the ball was. Neesham run out (Dhoni) 44(32) [4s-4 6s-2]",36.2
"Kedar Jadhav to Santner, 1 run, flatter and short, Santner punches it to long-on",36.1
"Bhuvneshwar to Neesham, SIX, change of angle from Bhuvneshwar, but it doesn't work. Bowls a juicy length ball on the stumps and Neesham muscles this over square leg, doesn't bother to run. 13 off the over",35.6
"Bhuvneshwar to Neesham, FOUR, the audacity he has to flick a pace bowler stylishly with a strong bottom hand grip! Wow, that's a great shot, Bhuvi bowls full and on the stumps, Neesham whips the ball literally for a one bounce four through mid-wicket",35.5

"Hardik Pandya to Neesham, no run, now the off-cutting slower ball bouncer, Neesham lets it pass",33.2
"Hardik Pandya to Neesham, SIX, nothing full ball, another knuckle ball attempted, the key to bowling knuckle ball is to change the grip last minute but Hardik Pandya showed the grip way too early for the batsman to read it from the hand, Neesham waited and slogged easily over mid-wicket",33.1

"Hardik Pandya to Neesham, 1 run, short of length delivery on the off stump, Neesham slogs it to deep mid-wicket",31.1
"Chahal to de Grandhomme, out Lbw!! Easy decision. Don't review that. In fact he's not even waiting to talk to Neesham. CDG was always vulnerable to the ball that doesn't turn away from him with that big bat-pad gap in his defence, this was the slider that came in with the angle and it struck right in front of middle and off stump. de Grandhomme lbw b Chahal 11(8) [4s-2]",30.6

"Chahal to de Grandhomme, 1 run, oh almost through the gate with this googly, lucky edge rolls into the on-side",28.4
"Chahal to Latham, out Lbw!! That looks plumb. So this is what Dhoni wanted Chahal to do consistently, bowl fuller and make him play the front foot shots. This time Latham got across the line to play the sweep shot, missed it completely and the ball landed in line with leg stump and luckily for Chahal didn't turn as much to miss the leg stump. Latham discussed with Neesham about the review and I reckon it was a good call not to review. That would not be umpire's call. So India have got both the set batsmen!

"Kedar Jadhav to Williamson, out Caught by Dhawan!! How many times has Kedar Jadhav broken a big stand? He's showing his dance moves and look at MSD, celebrating with his arms pointing up. Was there a plan? Couldn't pick up much from the stump mics. So with his seriously teasing and irritating slingly bowling action to batsmen, Kedar tempts Williamson with a short ball, the New Zealand skipper wanted to power this pull shot over the rope, but no pace was offered on the ball by the bowler, so in trying to generate some he holed out at deep mid-wicket.

"Hardik Pandya to Latham, no run, fuller and around middle, flicked well but finds the mid-wicket fielder",12.6
"Hardik Pandya to Latham, no run, another near drag on! Quite a few today, tells you about the two-paced nature of this pitch. Close to the off pole and Latham wanted to get it square through the off-side, gets an inside edge just past leg stump",12.5
"Hardik Pandya to Williamson, 1 run, this was close! Fullish inswinger, heading towards the pads and Williamson had to connect the flick, which he did. Gets it to the right of Chahal at mid-on",12.4

"Shankar to Williamson, no run, fuller and outside off, driven firmly back to the bowler",11.6
"Shankar to Latham, 1 run, walks across quite a bit and glances this down to fine leg. Would have been a goner if he missed this",11.5

"Hardik Pandya to Ross Taylor, out Lbw!! Hardik strikes a massive blow! Just two deliveries for the all-rounder to get into the act. Was the fizzing nipbacker and Taylor was stuck on the crease as he tried to play around the front pad. Couldn't make contact and that was a rather easy decision for the umpire. Taylor did have a chat with Williamson before walking off. Perhaps not confident enough to review it. India firmly on top with this wicket. Ross Taylor lbw b Hardik Pandya 1(4)",10.2
"Hardik Pandya to Ross Taylor, no run, fuller and closer to off stump, defended well off the front foot",10.1

"Shami to Munro, out Bowled!! Drags this onto the stumps! Munro finally runs out of luck and has to go. Shami has his second. Was a short of a length delivery that skid off the track, not the kind of pitch where you can stand and deliver the cut stroke but that's precisely what Munro tries. Goes real hard with no foot movement and can only inside edge this onto the sticks. Excellent first Powerplay so far for India. Munro b Shami 24(19) [4s-2 6s-1]",9.1

"Bhuvneshwar to Munro, no run, short of a good length and Munro wants to heave it away. Doesn't connect",8.4
"Bhuvneshwar to Munro, 2 runs, another mishit, lands safe! Munro is living adventurously. Comes down the track for a straight loft but miscues it horribly. Uppish but manages to clear a backtrekking mid-off fielder, goes over him",8.3
"Bhuvneshwar to Munro, FOUR, in the air but Munro has picked his spot! Probably a touch too straight in line and he launched it on the leg-side. Aerial alright and not off the middle either but he splits deep backward square leg and deep mid-wicket",8.2

"Bhuvneshwar to Williamson, no run, back of a length and Williamson stands tall to punch this towards point",6.6
"Bhuvneshwar to Munro, 1 run, the knuckle ball, on a good length and Munro was probably surprised by it. Inside edges this towards mid-wicket",6.5

"Bhuvneshwar to Munro, no run, good response from Bhuvi, fine yorker around off and it's dug out to point",6.3
"Bhuvneshwar to Munro, FOUR, told ya! He ain't gonna die wondering. In the slot around off, Munro just clears his front leg and clobbers this over mid-wicket after taking a couple of steps down the track. This should be an interesting over",6.2
"Bhuvneshwar to Munro, no run, probes away around the off pole on a good length, Munro pats this towards cover",6.1

"Shami to Williamson, no run, angling in from outside off, Williamson moves forward and blocks it towards cover",5.5
"Shami to Williamson, 2 runs, almost chopped onto the sticks! Near replica of KW's dismissal in the first ODI except that he didn't get bowled. Short of a length and seaming into him, he tried the cut stroke and got a thick inside edge that just missed leg stump down to fine leg. Come to think of it, the bowler was Shami in that game too",5.4
"Shami to Williamson, no run, fourth stump line on a length, dabbed with soft hands towards gully",5.3

"Bhuvneshwar to Williamson, no run, fuller and closer to off, angling into Williamson who defends down the track",4.5
"Bhuvneshwar to Williamson, no run, stays really low! Williamson is lucky that this wasn't straighter in line as it could have crashed into the timber. Was angled into him from around off, straightened just a tad and shot through low past the blade. On the bounce to Dhoni",4.4
"Bhuvneshwar to Williamson, no run, on a length around the fourth stump line, nervous dab from Williamson and he finds that gully fielder who is placed for this shot. Remember he nicked off to the keeper last game trying this shot",4.3

"Shami to Williamson, no run, full and closer to off stump, Williamson defends with soft hands towards the slip cordon",3.4
"Shami to Henry Nicholls, out Caught by Kedar Jadhav!! There's the early wicket India were searching for. Shami provides it with a short ball that skidded on after pitching. Nicholls was clearly late on the pull and didn't bother keeping it down either. Mistimed it towards mid-on where Jadhav took a sharp catch. It was travelling flat at him and by his standards, it's definitely a very good catch. Not sure Nicholls should have tried this shot though with Munro there at the other end. Henry Nicholls c Kedar Jadhav b Shami 8(15) [4s-1]",3.3
"Shami to Henry Nicholls, no run, that was there to be hit but Nicholls can't pick the gap. Short and wide, slaps the cut hard but straight to Shanker at backward point",3.2

"Bhuvneshwar to Henry Nicholls, no run, shapes in from a good length, Nicholls shuffles on the back foot and gets a faint inside edge onto the pad",2.1
"Shami to Henry Nicholls, 1 run, nearly a run out chance! Terrific effort from Shanker, dived to his left at point to make a half stop to save a boundary. He couldn't gather it cleanly quickly enough because the batsmen were having a mix up and a run out was a real possibility. Good shot to start with from Nicholls again, cut it well off the front foot",1.6
"Shami to Henry Nicholls, FOUR, classy shot! If Munro is about power, Nicholls prefers to time them. This was not all that full but he got across on the front foot and eased the straight drive past the diving mid-off fielder",1.5
"Shami to Henry Nicholls, no run, on a length wider outside off, Nicholls sits back and shoulders arms",1.4
"Shami to Henry Nicholls, 2 runs, thick inside edge! Skiddy good of a length delivery, angling into Nicholls who was late on the defensive push. Nearly chopped on, as the ball whizzes past the leg stump towards fine leg. Chahal was squarer and got around in time",1.3
"Shami to Henry Nicholls, no run, slanting in from a good length, just outside off and Nicholls stands tall to defend. A bit of extra bounce",1.2
