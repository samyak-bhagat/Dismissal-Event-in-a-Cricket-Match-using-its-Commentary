"Pradeep to Iftikhar Ahmed, SIX, oh no! Pradeep chose a poor time to deliver a full toss. It was just above the knee and at a perfect height for Iftikhar, who helps it all the way over fine leg for a maximum",48.1

Nothing but a straight ball to which Sohail makes room to carve it into the off-side, misses and the ball hits the top of off-stump. Jayasuriya generally darts it in and he defeated the batsman because of his pace there. Sohail has taken Pakistan close to victory and now it is up to others to take them over the line.

Back of a length delivery that cramps the batsman for room, Sarfaraz wanted to guide it to third man but since he didn't have the space to meet the ball, he inside edged it onto the stumps.

Anyway, it is another wrong decision that goes against his name. The nip-backer from Pradeep and Azam is not fully forward to deal with it, struck just above the kneeroll and height was always the question.
