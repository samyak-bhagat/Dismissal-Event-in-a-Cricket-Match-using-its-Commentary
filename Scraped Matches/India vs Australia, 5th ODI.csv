Lovely drift into the left hander, draws Pant on the forward defensive before the ball spins away, the outside edge pops up gently to Turner at slip. Australia are well ahead in the game now.

Rohit saw the length a touch full and wanted to launch it straight back over the bowler's head but got it more of the inner half of the blade.

"Pat Cummins to Kohli, 1 run, shortish and just outside off, steered with an open face down to third man",6.1
"J Richardson to Kohli, 1 run, had to hurry! Kohli was taking a definite risk here and fortunately for him, Stoinis' throw doesn't hit the target at the bowler's end.

"Pat Cummins to Kohli, 1 run, nearly a run out! Rohit responded late to the run and had Cummins in the way as the pacer tried to kick the ball onto the stumps at the keeper's end. Might have been close if it had hit. Was a faint inside edge onto the thigh pad from Kohli and they thought of taking the run",4.5
