"Starc to Imran Khan, out Caught by Wade!! Australia win by an innings and 5 runs. Hugs and handshakes all-round. There is a check for no-ball check and Starc is fine there. Khan was not going to hang around and as soon as he saw the full delivery, he went after it. The connection was not like the previous delivery, this one comes off the toe-end and skies up, Wade is stationed at deepish mid-on and he reverse cups it calmly. Imran Khan c Wade b Starc 5(6) [4s-1]",84.2

"Hazlewood to Shaheen Afridi, out Caught by Pat Cummins!! Easy peasy! This was bound to happen with all the swings Afridi was having. Short of length delivery and he is beaten for pace, tries to pull but the ball comes off the splice of the bat, lobs towards mid-off where Cummins accepts the dolly. Australia are one wicket away from wrapping this up. Shaheen Afridi c Pat Cummins b Hazlewood 10(18) [4s-2]",83.4

Hazlewood has another wicket to his name - Yasir's luck runs out, on a good length and angling into the right-hander, perhaps held onto the surface, Yasir was early into the tuck, closed the bat-face and the ball looped off the leading edge. Wade ran across to his right from cover, tumbled and completed a good two-handed catch. Yasir Shah c Wade b Hazlewood 42(55) [4s-6]",81.1

"Hazlewood to Rizwan, out Caught by Lyon!! No maiden Test hundred for Rizwan, but he walks off to huge cheers across the Gabba. Hazlewood strikes and that should be it for Pakistan's hopes of taking this Test into the final day. This was short and wide of off, Rizwan saw the opportunity of getting a boundary, arched back slightly and flat-batted it behind point, there was a man at deep backward point, Lyon it was, and Rizwan managed to find him to perfection.

"Lyon to Rizwan, no run, that's a stunning catch from Labuschagne, he's claiming it, but Rizwan isn't going anywhere. The third umpire will have a look, the soft signal is OUT. It's a fair delivery - he has caught it, but has the ball touched the ground while he completed it. Yes, it has, the third umpire has a look, NOT OUT is the call. Excellent effort from Labuschagne, but Rizwan survives - he wasn't in control over the catch and the ball did hit the grass - the lap sweep from Rizwan, went down low and got a top-edge onto his shoulder, the ball lobbed behind Paine's back - Labuschagne went across from FSL, Smith came across and dived from first slip - the ball stuck in the outstretched hands of Labuschagne, who thought it was a clean catch.
