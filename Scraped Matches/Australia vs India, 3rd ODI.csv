"Stoinis to Kedar Jadhav, FOUR, lofted over mid-wicket and that's the game and the series for India. Dhoni hugs Jadhav as his team-mates sport beaming smiles on their faces near the boundary. India won the Test series 2-1, they take the ODI series 2-1 and they have been unbeaten throughout with the T20s being shared",49.2
"Stoinis to Kedar Jadhav, no run, low full toss, driven to mid-off",49.1
"Siddle to Dhoni, no run, field up and this leg stump yorker is dug out to short mid-wicket. A big smile on Dhoni's face and then he gestures to Jadhav with his hand as if to say ""It's all yours now son!""",48.6
"Siddle to Dhoni, FOUR, full ball and it's been smashed. Finch has no chance at mid-off. The crowd are up on their feet. Dhoni waited for that ball to come and absolutely muscled that hard past the bowler",48.5
"Siddle to Dhoni, wide, another really poor wide down the leg-side. India are just a hit away now",48.5
"Siddle to Kedar Jadhav, 3 runs, batsman has a lot of time and area to play with on the off-side, however far you may follow him as a bowler, he can easily chip the ball over the infield, Jadhav plays this over backward point",48.4
"Siddle to Kedar Jadhav, no run, brilliant comeback from Siddle, Jadhav dances around in the crease, but Siddle nails the yorker, threatening to break the toe, dug out hurriedly by the batsman",48.3

Fifty for Kedar Jadhav, vital innings. Looked like he was just listening to whatever MSD was saying. Great hand from both the players",47.6
"Stoinis to Dhoni, 1 run, slower delivery down the leg-side, Dhoni flicks it to fine leg",47.5

"Stoinis to Dhoni, 1 run, Dhoni pulls this shortish delivery to fine leg",47.3
"Stoinis to Dhoni, FOUR, this is almost similar to the flick shot he played off Malinga in the 2011 World Cup final. Full toss down the leg-side, Dhoni flicks with strong bottom hand grip, fine leg fancies his chances, but there was enough power behind this shot",47.2
"Stoinis to Dhoni, 2 runs, in the airrrrr and dropped! Dhoni gets another life, oh there could be a run-out, Jadhav literally steals the second run. Full ball, Dhoni jumps out and smacks it hard, the ball flew to the left of Finch at mid-off, the Aussie captain dived to his left and got both hands to it, should have been held, but was not to be. Jadhav called for the second run and in the end he was saved by that brilliant full length dive that he put in and it saved him by a frame",47.1
"J Richardson to Dhoni, 1 run, down the leg-side, glanced to fine leg",46.6
"J Richardson to Kedar Jadhav, 1 run, Jadhav wants that scoop shot with backward square leg and fine leg inside the ring, but a good bowler would spot the batsman moving and bowl wide outside off stump like Richardson did now, swept in the air, but Maxi had too much ground to cover running to his right from deep mid-wicket",46.5

"J Richardson to Dhoni, 1 run, short, pulled nicely, but deep square leg runs to his right and cuts it off",46.2

"Siddle to Kedar Jadhav, wide, oh dear! Full toss past leg stump. All the good work done by Stoinis, Richardson and Zampa is being undone. This is what calculated assault is about from a chasing point of view, Dhoni and Jadhav know Siddle doesn't have many variations, so they weren't worried playing those dots, knowing they could catch up",45.2
"Siddle to Kedar Jadhav, FOUR, Siddle could be the bowler they would want to target. The bowler tried the yorker, bowled a perfect full ball in the slot for Jadhav to walk into the lofted off-drive to the left of mid-off",45.1
"Siddle to Kedar Jadhav, wide, oopsy! A freebie full toss down the leg-side, a tickle fine would have been four",45.1

"Zampa to Kohli, 1 run, driven through point",21.3
"Zampa to Kohli, no run, this is very unusual for the Dhoni-Kohli combo. Uncertainty in running. This time, it's brought about through some excellent fielding from Khawaja.

Dhoni takes two, no four steps down before shouting 'no'. Kohli was too far down by then. There's a smile from the Indian captain at the end of it. A smile",20.3
"Stoinis to Dhoni, no run, back of a length delivery close to off, he fancies the cut but there's just not enough room for it. Ends up chopping it off the under-edge onto the crease",20.2

Short of length outside off, it's a loose cut shot from the wicketkeeper-batsman with hardly any conviction. Carries comfortably to the left of backward point, but Maxwell puts it down",16.3
"Stoinis to Dhawan, out Caught&Bowled!! Those are sharp reflexes from Stoinis to grab the return catch. Dhawan was through the drive early on this slower ball, but it was still hit firmly enough.

"Zampa to Dhawan, no run, 92kph, darted in on leg stump. There's decent purchase for Zampa from back of a length and it rushes onto Dhawan's pad as he's late on the clip",12.6
