"Kuldeep Yadav to Ish Sodhi, out Bowled!! Cleans him around his legs! Comical dismissal for Sodhi but then he is a tailender and you can't really blame him for this. Walks across the stumps early and Kuldeep delivers the perfect chinaman delivery around middle and off. Spins in a tad, beats the attempted flick and castles Sodhi who looked in a daze there. Well, specialist batters aren't picking Kuldeep, so a no.9 stands no chance. Ish Sodhi b Kuldeep Yadav 0(1)",30.5

"Shami to Henry Nicholls, no run, excitement from Shami but turned down. Dhoni signals it to be missing leg and so, no review. Was a skiddy short of a length ball that pinged Nicholls on the back thigh. The angle might have just taken it down leg I suppose",27.4
"Shami to Henry Nicholls, FOUR, sloppy work from Jadhav. He did have some ground to cover from fine leg but he did that part, only to time the slide a tad badly. Was a short ball that was swivel-pulled by Nicholls to the deep backward suare leg fence",27.3

"Kuldeep Yadav to de Grandhomme, out Caught by Rayudu!! Not lucky this time, de Grandhomme! He wasn't going to die wondering but against Kuldeep, it's always risky especially if you aren't picking him. Another wrong 'un, flighted outside off and de Grandhomme got a fat top edge on the slog sweep. Still seemed to have enough on it to clear deep mid-wicket but Rayudu showed good presence of mind to pouch it inches from the ropes. Not an easy catch that with the mind frequently thinking of going across the fence. de Grandhomme c Rayudu b Kuldeep Yadav 3(8)",26.6

Kuldeep had to contend with the presence of Henry Nicholls at the non-striker's end, still got a hand across to his left on the dive but was always going to find it difficult to cling on. Was struck hard by de Grandhomme too but could have been in trouble",24.4
"Kuldeep Yadav to Latham, out Lbw!! Cracker of a delivery and Latham is out of here. Was nicely tossed up by the chinaman, very full as well and I don't think Latham picked the length at all. Got deceived in flight, was stuck in the crease and that hit him on the back pad, dead in front of the stumps. Shows how bamboozled Latham was and he is a quality player of spin, mind you! So, Kuldeep has his first and with this scalp, I reckon the little glimmer of hope that NZ had, has faded. Latham lbw b Kuldeep Yadav 34(32) [4s-3 6s-1]",24.3

"Kuldeep Yadav to Latham, no run, huge LBW shout, turned down! Dhoni says NO and they don't take the review. Was the chinaman from Kuldeep and pinged Latham on the front pad as he missed the sweep. Probably spun a bit after pitching and that's what influenced the umpire's decision",22.5

"Kedar Jadhav to Ross Taylor, out Stumped!! Another MSD special! Mostly when he appeals for a stumping, you've got to believe that there is a wicket opportunity there. This is sharp glovework. Jadhav got some drift and Taylor was beaten on the outside edge while trying to push at it. The back foot came up ever so slightly and that was enough for MS who whipped off the bails in a flash. He didn't appear that excited on the appeal, though he never is in anything that he does. Eventually, Taylor's a goner by the tiniest of margins.

"Chahal to Latham, no run, flattish outside off, punched to extra cover",16.6

"Chahal to Munro, out Lbw!! Munro's pinned in front, he walks up to Taylor to have a chat about the review and decides against it in the end. Overambitious from Munro, went for the reverse-slap after getting down on his knees. Chahal gets it to spin in from off and the southpaw fails to execute the shot. Hit on the tummy in front of the stumps and it looked plumb. Umpire Nigel Llong had no doubts and New Zealand have lost their third wicket. Munro lbw b Chahal 31(41) [4s-3 6s-1]",14.1

"Shami to Williamson, out Bowled!! ""That is Cricket for you, it's a great leveller,"" says Sunil Gavaskar on air. Shami redeems himself and prises out the New Zealand captain. He has the final laugh and it's a major blow to the hosts. This length delivery, jagged back in a little and tucked the batsman for room. Williamson went with a horizontal bat and ended up getting an inside edge which deflects back onto the stumps. Shami is delighted and so are the Indian fans at the ground.

"Shami to Williamson, SIX, action replay of the previous ball. Williamson takes on the short ball once again. Rotates clockwise and muscles it majestically. Half-a-dozen",7.2

"Bhuvneshwar to Guptill, out Caught by Chahal!! It was swirling in the air, Chahal was so close to the ropes at third man and does wonderfully to pouch it. Finally, Guptill runs out of luck and has to depart. Short ball works like a charm for Kumar. It was wide as well, Guptill goes hard and slashes it on the rise. Didn't control it at all and goes straight to Chahal at third man, who judges it well and cushions it onto his chest before tumbling on the ground. Bhuvi and India are pumped. Guptill c Chahal b Bhuvneshwar 15(16) [4s-2]",4.6

"Bhuvneshwar to Munro, no run, fuller on leg, pushed to mid-on",2.6
"Bhuvneshwar to Guptill, 1 run, MS Dhoni grasses it. Guptill is riding his luck. But you very rarely see MS shell a chance like this. Pretty straightforward, must say. Shorter and outside off, Guptill throws his bat with hard hands and outside-edges it behind. Dhoni had to move quickly, goes with one-hand but it hits the mitts and bobbles away to third man",2.5
