"Shankar to Zampa, out Bowled!! Vijay Shankar has done it! This is India's 500th ODI win. The umpires wanted to check if it was a fair delivery, no problems whatsoever. He bowls the perfect delivery. Slips in a yorker right in the blockhole and a backing away Zampa can't jam it out. Crashes into middle-stump. India win by 8 runs! Zampa b Shankar 2(2)",49.3
"Shankar to Zampa, 2 runs, Zampa moves leg-side and pats this length ball to the right of point, where Rohit dives and takes the pace off the ball. The batters collect a double because of that",49.2
"Shankar to Stoinis, out Lbw!! Wow! Stoinis has been adjudged lbw. And Stoinis has to review that. He does. Legal delivery. A seam-up delivery and Stoinis missed the heave. Hit him on the back leg adjacent to the sticks. Was there any bat involved? Nothing on UltraEdge. Over to HawkEye, now. Umpire's call on hitting wickets. The on-field call of umpire Nitin Menon stays. Stoinis is absolutely distraught. What drama here at Nagpur! Stoinis wanted to play a big heave and got done in by this in-slanter from a length. The impact was on middle and ball-tracking showed it to be clipping leg-stump. Stoinis lbw b Shankar 52(65) [4s-4 6s-1]",49.1
"Shami to Lyon, FOUR, this is bonus for Australia. Shami dishes out a full toss on leg, Lyon clears his front leg to hoick across the line and gets a thick inside edge that runs away fine and into the fine leg fence",48.6
"Shami to Stoinis, 1 run, Stoinis backs away and Shami follows him with a pacy back of a length delivery at 139.2kph. Stoinis is cramped for room and he can only drag it to long-on",48.5
"Shami to Lyon, 1 run, Shami bowls length and that's been cut hard to deep point",48.4
"Shami to Stoinis, 1 run, Stoinis walks forward and across to work this short of length delivery to square leg. Gives the strike to Lyon",48.3
"Shami to Stoinis, 2 runs, just out of square leg's reach. An uppish, wristy flick to a back of a length and the ball evaded a leaping Kuldeep to his left. Stoinis comes back for the second and notches up a fifty! He won't be too bothered about his milestone at this moment",48.2
"Shami to Stoinis, no run, short of a good length ball, Stoinis shimmies down and punches it back towards the bowler",48.1
"Bumrah to Stoinis, 1 run, a single off the final ball of the over. A short of a good length ball, Stoinis walks towards off and nudges it to square leg. Another good outing for Bumrah: 10-0-29-2",47.6
"Bumrah to Stoinis, no run, that was so close to the outside edge! Good length delivery that nibbles away ever so lightly, Stoinis was looking for another defensive push, missed the outside nick by a whisker",47.5
"Bumrah to Stoinis, no run, 140.8kph, short of length delivery, blocked into the off-side",47.4
"Bumrah to Stoinis, no run, 140.5kph, yorker, Stoinis squeezes it out to backward point and Lyon comes out of his crease. The fielder is Jadeja who mocks a throw at the bowler's end",47.3
"Bumrah to Stoinis, no run, 135.7kph, good length delivery, Stoinis prods across and defends it towards mid-off. Seems, the plan is to see off Bumrah",47.2
"Bumrah to Stoinis, no run, 137.9kph, in-slanter, Stoinis knocks it straight down the ground. Mid-off moves to his right to mop that up. Another single denied",47.1
"Shami to Lyon, no run, 139.5kph, in-curling yorker and Lyon brings his bat down and manages to get an inside edge that rolls to fine leg. Single not taken!",46.6
"Shami to Stoinis, 1 run, Stoinis uses the bowler's pace and width to run it down to third man",46.5
"Shami to Stoinis, FOUR, slight width on offer and Stoinis takes full toll of it. He stays leg-side of the ball and cuts this shortish ball beating backward point to his left. No chance for Bumrah (third man) to cut that off",46.4
"Shami to Stoinis, no run, stump-to-stump line ball, blocked back to the bowler",46.3
"Shami to Lyon, 1 run, sloppy from India. Lyon pokes this length ball to backward point and Kedar has a shy at the sticks at the striker's end. Missed the target and Rayudu (the backing up fielder) fumbled. That allows the batters to rotate strike",46.2
"Shami to Stoinis, 1 run, now he's decided to take the single. Strange tactics. Fullish ball on the stumps, Stoinis walks across to glance it to deep mid-wicket",46.1
"Bumrah to Lyon, no run, well, Stoinis has decided not to take a run. Lyon got an outside edge on this drive and the ball went down to third man. Just 1 run and 2 wickets off that over!",45.6
"Bumrah to Lyon, no run, 131.8kph, back of a length delivery, seam-up delivery that leaves the right-hander, Lyon pokes and gets beaten on the outside edge. An optimistic appeal from Bumrah, Dhoni and the crowd",45.5
"Bumrah to Pat Cummins, out Caught by Dhoni!! Dhoni appeals, umpire Nitin Menon has a word with his partner and decides to go upstairs. The soft signal is OUT! Legal ball. That's a clean catch. Pat Cummins departs for a 2-ball duck. Australia have lost their eighth wicket, they still need 28 runs to win. This guy - Bumrah - is incredible at the death overs. And, he's showing it why, again! A pacy short of length delivery marginally outside off and Cummins had a poke at it, without any major feet movement. He got a faint outside edge and Dhoni took a sharp, low catch. Dhoni was late to appeal and that might have created a doubt in the umpire's mind. Pat Cummins c Dhoni b Bumrah 0(2)",45.4
"Bumrah to Pat Cummins, no run, 139.9kph, full ball on middle and leg, blocked back to the bowler",45.3
"Bumrah to Coulter-Nile, out Bowled!! Knocked him over. 142.6kph! Bumrah attacks the stumps from a good length, nipped in a bit off the deck. A mediocre stroke from Coulter-Nile. Against a straight ball, he was trying to cut. Neither the length was short, nor the line was wide. He missed it and the ball made a mess of the timber. India fighting back, here! Coulter-Nile b Bumrah 4(4)",45.2
"Bumrah to Stoinis, 1 run, 141.5kph, in-angling length ball, Stoinis opens the bat-face and dinks it down to third man",45.1
"Kuldeep Yadav to Coulter-Nile, 2 runs, Coulter-Nile decides to slog this full tossed up ball across the line. Doesn't middle it and the ball goes up in the air. Luckily for the batsman, the ball lands between the two men in the deep (long-on and deep mid-wicket). Rayudu slides to his right and parries it to Vijay Shankar. Kuldeep - 10-0-54-3",44.6
"Kuldeep Yadav to Coulter-Nile, 2 runs, that's a decent shot from Coulter-Nile. Touch short from Kuldeep, Coulter-Nile went back and lifted it over extra cover. Long-off mops up",44.5
"Kuldeep Yadav to Coulter-Nile, no run, flighted delivery, googly, not sure if the batter picked that. He had decided to block, the ball hits the bat and dies down on the off-side",44.4
"Kuldeep Yadav to Carey, out Bowled!! No major celebrations from the Indians. Loads of flight on this full ball and Kuldeep got it to drift in a bit. Carey went through with his premeditated sweep shot and ended up dragging it onto his stumps - courtesy an under edge. Carey b Kuldeep Yadav 22(24) [4s-2]",44.3
"Kuldeep Yadav to Stoinis, 1 run, slower delivery - 78.9kph, spinning into the pads, helped on its way to deep square leg",44.2
"Kuldeep Yadav to Stoinis, FOUR, poor from Kuldeep Yadav. Tries to bowl the quicker one - 101.7kph, but errs in line and length. Short and wide outside off, Stoinis stands tall and slaps it through backward point",44.1
"Shami to Stoinis, 1 run, Shami slips in a full toss and Stoinis is happy to drive it down to long-on. Six balls, six singles in this over",43.6
"Shami to Carey, 1 run, off-pace short ball, Carey pulls hard, straight to deep mid-wicket",43.5
"Shami to Stoinis, 1 run, to cover, 136.3kph, not much roon on offer on this short of length delivery, with an angled bat Stoinis manages to pat it towards cover",43.4
"Shami to Carey, 1 run, pitched up delivery, Carey wrists the drive to long-on",43.3
"Shami to Stoinis, 1 run, loud shot for lbw, the umpire shakes his head in denial. A skiddy length short of length seam-up delivery, Stoinis is cramped for room. Tries to work it through the leg-side and I'm not sure if there was an inside edge there. Height was another factor going against the fielding side",43.2
"Shami to Carey, 1 run, 132.4kph, short of length delivery marginally outside off from round the wicket, steered to third man",43.1
"Kuldeep Yadav to Stoinis, no run, 81.8kph, very full and that's been squeezed back to the bowler",42.6
"Kuldeep Yadav to Stoinis, SIX, 15 off the over with a ball to go! Good use of the feet from Stoinis. Comes down the track, gets close to the pitch of the leggie and hoists it over long-on. High and handsome",42.5
"Kuldeep Yadav to Carey, 1 run, Kuldeep drags his length tad too short and Carey cuts this well in front of square, Vijay Shankar is swift to mop that up. Keeps the batters down to a single",42.4
"Kuldeep Yadav to Carey, FOUR, powerful stroke! Slower through the air, fuller on this occasion, Carey gets down on a knee and smashes it through the mid-wicket region with a sweep shot",42.3
"Kuldeep Yadav to Carey, no run, short again, Kuldeep gets away as Carey finds backward point with his cut shot",42.2
"Kuldeep Yadav to Carey, FOUR, good shot! Not a great ball from Kuldeep Yadav, tad short with loads of width outside off. Carey rocks back on seeing that and scythes it fiercely behind square on the off-side. A desperate dive from Vijay Shankar in the deep to his right, but in vain",42.1
"Bumrah to Carey, 1 run, Carey hops and opens his bat-face to tap this short of length delivery towards cover for a quick single. Another tight over - just 3 off it",41.6
"Bumrah to Stoinis, 1 run, 137.9kph, in-slanter, Stoinis gets beaten for pace as well as the angle. Missed the glance and rolled towards point off his body. Given as runs, but replays show that there was no inside edge",41.5
"Bumrah to Stoinis, no run, 140.2kph, length ball around off, a miscued punch to cover follows",41.4
"Bumrah to Stoinis, no run, 137.1kph, fullish ball, a seam-up delivery that didn't bounce much. Stoinis is beaten on the outside edge as he tries to drive away from his body. No feet movement there from Stoinis",41.3
"Bumrah to Stoinis, no run, length ball, punched to cover",41.2
"Bumrah to Carey, 1 run, 140kph, skiddy back of a length delivery from round the wicket, Carey gets inside the line of it and tickles it to fine leg",41.1

"Kuldeep Yadav to Carey, no run, turning away from the left-hander, cut straight to backward point",40.5
"Kuldeep Yadav to Carey, 2 runs, slower through the air, Carey gets down to broom it away to backward square leg",40.4
"Kuldeep Yadav to Carey, no run, tad short, Carey miscues the cut to cover. It would have been a wide had he let go",40.3
"Kuldeep Yadav to Carey, no run, an appeal for lbw, turned down. Did that hit the pad first? Yes, but the impact was wide of off. The non-turner and Carey was late on his block. Umpire's call on impact (marginally outside off) and missing off - according to HawkEye",40.2
"Kuldeep Yadav to Carey, no run, tossed up delivery, Carey tries to play the premeditated sweep shot, spun a bit as well. Hits the toe-end and died down on the pitch",40.1
"Bumrah to Carey, 1 run, short of length delivery outside off, cuts it to deep point",39.6
"Bumrah to Carey, no run, back of a length delivery on off, blocked into the covers",39.5
"Bumrah to Stoinis, 1 run, cramps him up with the in-ducker and Stoinis drags it off a thick inside edge onto the pad. They go through for the single as the ball rolls away into the off-side",39.4
"Bumrah to Stoinis, no run, short of length on off, no room, Stoinis blocks",39.3
"Bumrah to Carey, 1 run, short of length delivery just outside off, rides the bounce nicely and dabs it wide of Jadeja at backward point, who manages to get a hand diving to his wrong side",39.2
"Bumrah to Carey, no run, full ball just outside off, skewed off the inside half into the on-side",39.1
"Kedar Jadhav to Stoinis, 2 runs, pretty slow through the air around off, Stoinis uses all the pace that it has and reverse-paddles it for a couple. Got it fine enough to beat the fielder",38.6
"Kedar Jadhav to Carey, 1 run, skidding in on middle, Carey punches it down to long-on",38.5
"Kedar Jadhav to Carey, no run, back of a length delivery sliding through outside off, punches it to short cover",38.4
"Kedar Jadhav to Stoinis, 1 run, that's agonizingly low from Jadhav. Short ball outside off, yet it gets only up around the ankles. Stoinis somehow cuts it through point",38.3
"Kedar Jadhav to Stoinis, no run, bit further up this time, Stoinis cuts it to the fielder",38.2
"Kedar Jadhav to Stoinis, FOUR, Jadhav drops it short outside off again, maybe will have to rethink from where he's delivering the ball, which is from behind the stumps. Stoinis slaps it through the cover field",38.1
"Shami to Carey, 2 runs, back of a length delivery on leg stump, clipped nicely through midwicket by Carey to get off the mark",37.6
"Shami to Carey, wide, down the leg-side this time, an area where Shami has been rather off today - his discipline",37.6
"Shami to Carey, no run, slower ball on middle, defended to short extra cover",37.5
"Shami to Stoinis, 1 run, short and wide, Stoinis slaps it through to sweeper cover",37.4
"Shami to Handscomb, out Handscomb Run Out!! Not smart, not smart at all. Jadeja's the last person you want to be taking a risky single against. Good length around off, stabbed in front of backward point. Handscomb hesitates, as he should, but then rather than sending his partner back, he obliges. The bounce is favourable for Jadeja, it's his favourable left hand too and he's right on target with the rocket throw, as he so often is. Completely unnecessary from Australia. Handscomb run out (Jadeja) 48(59) [4s-4]",37.3
"Shami to Handscomb, FOUR, full ball slanted in on middle, Handscomb keeps his shape, doesn't overhit which can be seen in how little flourish there is with the bat, and just lifts it over midwicket. All he was looking to do was clear the infield. The timing took care of the rest",37.2
"Shami to Handscomb, no run, cuts back in slightly from a good length and Handscomb mistimes the drive off the inside half to mid-on",37.1
"Kedar Jadhav to Stoinis, FOUR, this time Stoinis stayed right back in the crease, even made some room for himself by backing away and crashed this through the off-side ring. Only had to beat the infield as there was no one protecting the boundary",36.6
"Kedar Jadhav to Stoinis, no run, bowling from well behind the crease here, and so Stoinis isn't able to get to the length as he advances. Punches it back",36.5
"Kedar Jadhav to Handscomb, 1 run, reverse-swipes this flighted delivery to short third man",36.4
"Kedar Jadhav to Handscomb, 2 runs, that's well played by Handscomb, using a reverse-paddle to get this leg-stump delivery fine of backward point. But with Jadhav providing so little pace, it's never going to reach the boundary",36.3
"Kedar Jadhav to Handscomb, no run, length ball skidding through around off, Handscomb leans back and chops it to short extra cover",36.2
"Kedar Jadhav to Handscomb, no run, sliding through from a length on middle, turned to midwicket",36.1
"Jadeja to Handscomb, 1 run, swept to deep square leg. Jadeja finishes with figures of 1/48. Safe to say India would've expected more out of him on this surface",35.6
"Jadeja to Handscomb, FOUR, he gets the sweep away this time, and nails it in the gap. Fetches the ball from outside off and shovels it through backward square. Jadeja gets a bit of a scolding from Dhoni about the faster pace that he's bowling at",35.5
"Jadeja to Handscomb, no run, enough purchase for Jadeja to beat Handscomb's attempted sweep. Wanted to fetch that from outside off, a difficult proposition as it is, and wasn't helped by the turn on it",35.4
"Jadeja to Stoinis, 1 run, steps out, takes this on the full and whips it down to long-on",35.3
"Jadeja to Handscomb, leg byes, 1 run, darted in on middle and leg, beats Handscomb on the sweep and strikes the pad. Would've missed leg stump",35.2
"Jadeja to Handscomb, no run, such a risky shot to play against Jadeja who keeps it straight most of the time. Skidding into off stump from round the wicket, Handscomb makes room to cut but gets cramped up and just about chops it away",35.1
"Kedar Jadhav to Stoinis, no run, works this length ball to square leg",34.6
"Kedar Jadhav to Stoinis, no run, short and wide outside off, poor delivery really, but Stoinis slaps it straight to cover-point",34.5
"Kedar Jadhav to Stoinis, wide, down the leg-side from Jadhav, Stoinis doesn't get anything on it",34.5
"Kedar Jadhav to Stoinis, no run, clips it to midwicket",34.4
"Kedar Jadhav to Stoinis, no run, Stoinis has a big laugh about this, but it can't hide how he's struggling. Back of a length on leg stump, looks to swat it into the leg-side but is struck on the thigh instead",34.3
"Kedar Jadhav to Stoinis, no run, slides past the outside edge. Stoinis is expecting the ball to turn but it goes straight on",34.2
"Kedar Jadhav to Stoinis, no run, reckon he delivered that from behind the stump line. Length ball which Stoinis fails to get to the pitch of after shimmying down, settles for an on-side defence",34.1
"Jadeja to Handscomb, no run, 95kph, flat on middle, Handscomb mistimes the punch to the straight midwicket fielder",33.6
"Jadeja to Handscomb, no run, drifting in on middle, turned to short midwicket. Slowed it up there, Jadeja",33.5
"Jadeja to Stoinis, 1 run, overpitched on middle, squeezed down to long-off",33.4
"Jadeja to Handscomb, 1 run, full at the stumps, eased down to long-on",33.3
"Jadeja to Handscomb, FOUR, Handscomb doesn't chance the fine sweep after the warning Dhoni gave him in the previous over. Instead, he goes harder and belts it wide of fine leg",33.2
"Jadeja to Stoinis, 1 run, clipped off the pads through square leg",33.1
"Kedar Jadhav to Handscomb, no run, fails to get the sweep away from outside off, it snuck underneath him. Jadhav's low bounce proving very effective again",32.6
"Kedar Jadhav to Handscomb, no run, this would've been quite sensational from Dhoni had he held on. Anticipated the paddle sweep from Handscomb, managed to shuffle across by a couple of yards to his left and that's exactly where the ball came. He even got both hands to it, but it popped out",32.5
"Kedar Jadhav to Handscomb, 2 runs, he's used this paddle-sweep quite fruitfully in this innings. Plays it nice and fine for a couple of runs",32.4
"Kedar Jadhav to Handscomb, no run, length ball skidding through outside off, punched to extra cover",32.3
"Kedar Jadhav to Handscomb, no run, bit short outside off, he's a tough customer to play the cut against and Handscomb finds extra cover",32.2
"Kedar Jadhav to Stoinis, 1 run, quite round-arm, floated up on off, Stoinis pushes down to long-off",32.1
"Jadeja to Stoinis, 1 run, skidding through from back of a length outside off, punched down to long-off",31.6
"Jadeja to Stoinis, no run, pushed to cover",31.5
"Jadeja to Stoinis, no run, stays on the back foot to a length ball and punches it to cover",31.4
"Jadeja to Handscomb, 1 run, sliding in on middle and leg, Handscomb glances it down to fine leg",31.3
"Jadeja to Stoinis, 3 runs, uncertainly pushes at a length ball that's turning away from him. It runs off a thick outside edge past slip and it'll be a big chase for point. They complete the two, and then take one on the throw",31.2
"Jadeja to Stoinis, no run, drifting in on middle, defended forward",31.1
"Kuldeep Yadav to Stoinis, 1 run, flighted googly turning away outside off, Stoinis has a half-hearted bunt down to long-off",30.6
"Kuldeep Yadav to Stoinis, no run, it's only Kuldeep who's appealing for the leg-before. Dharmasena turns it down. May have been the googly this. Tossed up on a length, pitching in line with leg stump and kicking up onto the flap of the pad. Too high maybe. Was in fact the leg-break, but it was bouncing over nevertheless",30.5
"Kuldeep Yadav to Stoinis, no run, 73.2kph, flighted up across off, turning back in, Stoinis has his bat much closer to the pad in defence",30.4
"Kuldeep Yadav to Stoinis, no run, flighted up on off, played back down the pitch",30.3
"Kuldeep Yadav to Stoinis, no run, turned to short midwicket",30.2
"Kuldeep Yadav to Stoinis, no run, that's gone right through the gate and probably bounced over the top of off! What a ball. Enticingly tossed up outside off, drifting away teasingly, getting Stoinis to lean across and then turning past the inside edge. Kuldeep can't believe that's missed the stumps",30.1
"Bumrah to Stoinis, 1 run, back of a length outside off, Stoinis mistimes the punch wide of cover and sets off. That is another good over from Bumrah, he's conceded two runs off his two overs in this spell",29.6
"Bumrah to Stoinis, no run, slower delivery and Stoinis defends into the leg-side. Five dots..",29.5
"Bumrah to Stoinis, no run, fuller and outside off, Stoinis pushes it past Shankar at cover, but the duo don't risk a single as Kohli is quick to swoop down from mid-off",29.4

"Kuldeep Yadav to Stoinis, 1 run, on the shorter side and it is an easy pick away for Stoinis through mid-wicket",28.4
"Kuldeep Yadav to Maxwell, out Bowled!! Cleaned up! First time Kuldeep has dismissed Maxwell. What a time to do it. The pressure was building and you could sense something about to give and it is the wicket of the in-form Maxwell. It was dropped short but on this surface where the bounce is uneven it is almost suicidal playing the pull, Maxwell goes for it and is done in by the lack of bounce, the ball sneaks underneath the bat to disturb the furniture. Big wicket for India. Maxwell b Kuldeep Yadav 4(18)",28.3
"Kuldeep Yadav to Maxwell, no run, shortens the length and Maxwell carves the punch to point. Pressure on..",28.2
"Kuldeep Yadav to Maxwell, no run, tossed up outside off, Maxwell drives and finds extra cover in the way",28.1

"Kuldeep Yadav to Maxwell, 1 run, flighted and lands it full, Maxwell drives it down to long-on",26.6
"Kuldeep Yadav to Maxwell, no run, good work from Maxwell. It is never easy with Dhoni behind the stumps. He was beaten by the wrong 'un and the back foot was lifted for a nano second, but it came down before Dhoni could light up the stumps. Kuldeep also appealed for a caught behind but umpire Kumar Dharmasena didn't reckon there was an edge",26.5

"Jadeja to Shaun Marsh, out Caught by Dhoni!! Gone! India have a lucky breakthrough. Marsh is strangled down leg. Umpire Nitin Menon had his finger up in a flash and Marsh knew there was some wood. He started walking as soon as the decision was made. Spinning down leg, Marsh shuffles and gets inside the line, in an attempt to tickle it, he gets faint edge to Dhoni. Good grab that as it was turning sharply and there was an edge as well. Shaun Marsh c Dhoni b Jadeja 16(27)",23.5
"Jadeja to Shaun Marsh, no run, touch quicker and outside off, Marsh bunts it into the off-side",23.4

"Kedar Jadhav to Khawaja, out Caught by Kohli!! The one-brings-two phenomenon. Such a soft dismissal and Virat is all pumped like he is always. The round-armish dart outside off, Khawaja underestimated the dip there as he goes hard at it in trying to work it across the line. Comes off the leading edge and balloons up to captain Kohli at extra cover. The golden arm of Jadhav strikes for India and the visitors have lost both openers in two overs.

The Australian captain walks up to Khawaja and has a chat, but decides to trudge off. First wicket for India and the spirited opening partnership has been broken. It was flighted too full, Finch went low for the sweep and paid the price. Wasn't the ideal shot as it was dipping as well. Gets struck low on the pad and umpire Kumar Dharmasena reckoned the impact was in-line. Finch lbw b Kuldeep Yadav 37(53) [4s-5 6s-1]",14.3
